<p>
database: collection of data with
</p>
<ul>
<li>
logical structure

<li>
specific semantics

<li>
specific group of users

</ul>

<p>
Why not in files? There's no query language, a weak logical structure, no efficient access, almost no protection from data loss, no parallel access control.
</p>

<p>
ANSI SPARC architecture stores data in three levels:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
View level: application programs hide details of data types. Hide information for privacy/security

<li>
Logical level ('conceptual schema'): describes data and relations among data

<li>
Physical level: how data is stored, in disk pages, index structures, whatever else.

</ol>

<div id="Databases-Introduction-Relational databases"><h3 id="Relational databases" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Introduction-Relational databases">Relational databases</a></h3></div>
<p>
view and logical levels are data representations in relations/tables
</p>

<p>
a row is a tuple record. the order of the elements of the tuples doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
a database instance is a 'snapshot' of a database at a certain point in time.
</p>

<p>
the database schema is the structure of the database - the relations and constraints.
</p>

<p>
constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
primary key (would be underlined) uniquely identifies a row in a table (<code>customer(id, name, street, city)</code>)

<li>
a foreign key that points to a record in a different table (<code>account(depository → customer, accountnr)</code>)

<li>
data types, constrained data types

<li>
columns constraints (e.g. unique, nullability, counter)

<li>
check constraints (logical expression for a domain)

</ul>

<p>
create an entity relationship model in UML:
</p>

<p>
<img src="img-databases/entity-relationship-model.png" alt="Entity relationship model" />
</p>

<p>
then translate that into relations
</p>

<div id="Databases-Introduction-Database management system"><h3 id="Database management system" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Introduction-Database management system">Database management system</a></h3></div>
<p>
database management system (DBMS) allows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
create, modify database

<li>
query data using query language (retrieve)

<li>
support persistent storage of large amounts of data

<li>
allow durability and recovery

<li>
control access to data by users in parallel, without unexpected interactions among users (isolation) or partial actions (atomicity)

</ul>

<p>
multiple users, concurrent access. transactions have ACID proeprties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Atomicity: transaction executes fully or not at all (commit/abort)

<li>
Consistency: database remains in a consistent state where all integrity constraints hold

<li>
Isolation: multiple users can modify database at same time but will not see each other's partial actions

<li>
Durability: when a transaction is successfully committed, modified data is persistent regardless of disk crashes

</ul>

<p>
DBMS have data independence and duplication avoidance.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Logical independence: logical schema doesn't depend on views

<li>
Physical independence: changing physical schema doesn't break the logical schema

</ul>


<div id="Databases-Introduction-SQL: Structured Query Language"><h3 id="SQL: Structured Query Language" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Introduction-SQL: Structured Query Language">SQL: Structured Query Language</a></h3></div>
<p>
SQL is declarative data manipulation language. The user says which conditions the retrieved data has to fulfill.
</p>

<p>
It's more concise than imperaive languages, thus easier to maintain and cheaper to develop programs in it.
</p>

<p>
Users usually don't have to think about efficiency, the DBMS will manage that.
</p>

<p>
Creating a table with constraints:
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE solved (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    homework NUMERIC(2) NOT NULL,
    points NUMERIC(2) NOT NULL CHECK (points &lt;= 10),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
</pre>

<p>
Creating a view:
</p>

<pre>
CREATE VIEW solved_homework AS
    SELECT id, name, homework FROM solved;
</pre>

<div id="Databases-The relational model"><h2 id="The relational model" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model">The relational model</a></h2></div>
<div id="Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state"><h3 id="Concepts: schema, state" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state">Concepts: schema, state</a></h3></div>
<p>
<img src="img-databases/database-schema-tree.png" alt="Database schema tree" />
</p>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Data types"><h4 id="Data types" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Data types">Data types</a></h4></div>
<p>
all table entries are data values that conform to some selection of data types.
</p>

<p>
example data types:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
strings:

<ul>
<li>
<code>VARCHAR(n)</code> strings up to n characters, use this if you know a certain maximum length

<li>
<code>TEXT</code> variable length up to 2 GB (but does not always take up 2 GB)

</ul>
<li>
numbers:

<ul>
<li>
<code>INT</code> integer

<li>
<code>NUMERIC(n)</code> decimal number with n digits

</ul>
<li>
date and time

<li>
binary data, like a <code>BLOB</code> (binary large object)

</ul>

<p>
domain <code>val(D)</code> of a type D is the set of possible values for that type
</p>

<p>
with SQL, we can create our own application-specific domains (new data types). examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>CREATE DOMAIN EXNUM AS NUMERIC(2)</code>

<li>
<code>CREATE DOMAIN EXNUM AS NUMERIC(2) CHECK(VALUE &gt; 0)</code>

</ul>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Relation schema"><h4 id="Relation schema" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Relation schema">Relation schema</a></h4></div>
<p>
relation schema s (schema of single relation) defines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
finite sequence A₁..An of distinct attribute names

<li>
for each attribute Ai a data type (domain) Di

</ul>

<p>
written as: s = { A₁ : D₁, ..., An : Dn }
</p>

<p>
SQL notation:
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE exercises 
    (CAT    CHAR(1),
     ENO    NUMERIC(2),
     TOPIC  VARCHAR(40),
     MAXPT  NUMERIC(2))
</pre>

<p>
a relational database schema S defines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
finite set of relation names {R₁, ..., Rm}

<li>
for every relation R a relation schema sch(R)

<li>
a set of C integrity constraints

</ul>

<p>
so S = ({R₁, ..., Rm}, sch, C)
</p>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Tuples"><h4 id="Tuples" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Tuples">Tuples</a></h4></div>
<p>
used to formalize table rows.
so e.g. in table exercises: <code>(’H’, 1, ’Rel.Alg.’, 10)</code>
</p>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Database states"><h4 id="Database states" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Concepts: schema, state-Database states">Database states</a></h4></div>
<p>
let a database schema ({R₁, ..., Rm}, schema, C) be given.
</p>

<p>
a database state I for this database schema defines for every relation name Ri to a finite set of tuples I(Ri) w.r.t the relation schema Schema(Ri)
</p>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Null values"><h3 id="Null values" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Null values">Null values</a></h3></div>
<p>
relational model allows missing attribute values.
</p>

<p>
these are represented by <code>NULL</code>. not the same as 0 or an empty string.
</p>

<p>
used to model scenarios like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a value exists IRL but is not known

<li>
no value exists

<li>
attribute is not applicable

<li>
any value will do

</ul>

<p>
without null values, you'd have to split a relation into specific relations, like <code>student_with_email</code> and <code>student_without_email</code>. or the users would have to make up a fake value, which would not be uniform and you'd have no idea how to query.
</p>

<p>
problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
no clear semantics, since null values can be used in many scenarios

<li>
SQL has three-valued logic (true, false, unknown), so if you want to check for null, you have to say <code>WHERE A IS NULL</code>

</ul>

<p>
so declaring many attributes as NOT NULL simplifies the program, but only do that if you're sure that there's always a value.
</p>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Constraints"><h3 id="Constraints" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Constraints">Constraints</a></h3></div>
<p>
the database should be an image of the relevant subset of the real world. plain definition of tables often allows too many database states.
</p>

<p>
Integrity constraints (IC): conditions which every database state has to satisfy, restricting the set of possible database states.
</p>

<p>
In <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, possible constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>NOT NULL</code>: no value in this column can be null

<li>
<code>Keys</code>: each key value can only appear once

<li>
<code>Foreign keys</code>: values in a column must appear as key values in another table

<li>
<code>CHECK</code>: column values have to satisfy a given predicate

</ul>

<p>
Why specify constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
some protection against data input errors

<li>
document knowledge about database states

<li>
enforce law/company standards

<li>
protect against inconsistency

<li>
simplify queries in programs

</ul>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Keys"><h3 id="Keys" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Keys">Keys</a></h3></div>
<p>
key of relation R is attribute A that uniquely identifies tuples in R. this refers to all possible database states, not just the current one.
</p>

<p>
key constraint is satisfied in database state iff all tuples have different values for A.
</p>

<p>
once something is declared as a key, the DBMS refuses insertion of tuples with duplicate key values.. this refers to all possible database states, not just the current one.
</p>

<p>
keys can consist of several attributes, then they are composite keys. if columns A,B form a composite key, there cannot be two tuples t ≠ u which agree in both attributes. keys should never change.
</p>

<p>
a key constraint becomes weaker (less restrictive) if attributes are added to it.
</p>

<p>
a key is minimal if no attribute can be removed without destroying the key constraint.
</p>

<p>
a relation may have more than one minimal key. one is the primary key, which cannot be null. other keys are alternate/secondary.
</p>

<p>
choosing a primary key: single simple attribute, never updated
</p>

<div id="Databases-The relational model-Keys-Foreign keys"><h4 id="Foreign keys" class="header"><a href="#Databases-The relational model-Keys-Foreign keys">Foreign keys</a></h4></div>
<p>
use key attributes to uniquely reference a tuple, like a pointer. denoted with arrows:
</p>

<pre>
RESULTS (SID → STUDENTS,
        (CAT, ENO) → EXERCISES,
        POINTS)
        STUDENTS (SID,FIRST,LAST,EMAIL)
        EXERCISES (CAT,ENO,TOPIC,MAXPT)
</pre>

<p>
to refer from relation R to tuples of S, add primary key attributes of S to attributes of R. only stable if the logical 'address' of a tuple does not change.
</p>

<p>
implements a one-to-many relationship.
</p>

<p>
an existence guarantee is needed.
</p>

<p>
foreign key constraints in SQL:
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE RESULTS (
    ...
    FOREIGN KEY (SID) REFERENCES STUDENTS(SID)
)
</pre>

<p>
this ensures that every referenced row exists, which ensures referential integrity of the database.
</p>

<p>
these operations violate the constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
insertion into table with foreign key without matching referenced tuple. DBMS rejects update.

<li>
deletion from table if the tuple is referenced via foreign key. either DBMS rejects, both are deleted (cascade), or foreign key is set to null.

</ul>

<p>
only keys may be referenced. a table with composite key must be referenced by composite key that has same number of attributes. 
</p>

how are the elements related to each other

<li>
what are the constraints

<li>
modles: Entity/Relationship, UML

static, models the structure and not operations. no methods or functions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
rectangles represent entity sets

<li>
ellipses represent attributes

<ul>
<li>
double line - multivalued attributes 

<li>
dashed line - derived attributes

</ul>
<li>
diamonds are relationship sets

<li>

<div id="Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets"><h4 id="Entity sets" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets">Entity sets</a></h4></div>
<p>
entity is an abstract object (person, company, event..)
</p>

<p>
entitties have attributes (names, addresses, ...)
</p>

<p>
entity set is is a collection of similar entities (those sharing the same attributes).
</p>

<p>
represented by a set of attributes - descriptive properties possessed by all entities. the domain is set of permitted values for each attribute.
</p>

<p>
attribute types:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
simple and composite (e.g. street is composed of street name and number)

<li>
number of values:

<ul>
<li>
single-valued: e.g. age of a person

<li>
multivalued: e.g. person can have multiple phone numbers

</ul>
<li>
derived attributes:

<ul>
<li>
can be computed from other attributes

<li>
e.g. age computed from date of birth

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets-Weak entity sets"><h5 id="Weak entity sets" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Entity sets-Weak entity sets">Weak entity sets</a></h5></div>
<p>
a weak entity set doesn't have a primary key. its existence depends on existence of an identifying entity set. 
</p>

<p>
there has to be a total, one-to-may relationship set from identifying to weak entity set, shown by double diamond.
</p>

<p>
disciminator: a partial key, distinguishing weak entity only in combination with identifying entity. denoted by dashed underline.
</p>

<p>
primary key of weak entity set is combination of discriminator and primary key of identifying entity set.
</p>

<div id="Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Relationship sets"><h4 id="Relationship sets" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Relationship sets">Relationship sets</a></h4></div>
<p>
a relationship is association among several entities (a tuple (e₁, e₂, ...) of entities)
</p>

<p>
a relationship set is a set of relationship of same kind. i.e. a set of tuples (e₁, e₂, ...) where e₁ ∈ E₁, e₂ ∈ E₂, etc. Can have attributes.
</p>

<p>
example in UML with a relationship set <em>plays-in</em> and role indicators:
</p>

<p>
<img src="img-databases/relationship-set-example.png" alt="Relationship set example" />
</p>

<p>
cardinality limits express number of entities to which another entity can be associated via relationship set:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
0...1 means zero or one

<li>
1...1 means precisely one

<li>
0...* means any number

<li>
1...* means at least one

</ul>

<p>
if cardinalities are not given, the default is many-to-many.
</p>

<p>
total participation: every entity in the entity set participates in at least one relationship in the relatinoship set
</p>

<p>
partial participation: entities may not participate in any relationship in the set
</p>

<p>
degree of a relationship set is number of entity sets participating in the relationship.
</p>

<div id="Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Is-a (inheritance)"><h4 id="Is-a (inheritance)" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Database design: Conceptual models-Conceptual models: Entity-Relationship &amp; UML-Is-a (inheritance)">Is-a (inheritance)</a></h4></div>
<p>
lower-level entity sets are subgroups of the higher-level entity sets (e.g. an employee 'is a' person)
</p>

<p>
<img src="img-databases/is-a-example.png" alt="Is a example" />
</p>

<p>
lower-level entity sets inherit all attributes and relationships of the higher-level entity sets
</p>

<p>
you can go top-down and find subgroups (specialisation) or bottom-up and combine entity sets (generalisation)
</p>

<p>
constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
membership: value-based, assigns entity to subclass based on attribute vlues

<li>
disjointness: an entity can belong to at most one subclass (default is overlapping, where it can belong to multiple)

<li>
completeness: total specialisation, each superclass entity must belong to a subclass

</ul>

<p>
attributes are shown within box of entity set, not as separate ellipses.
</p>

<p>
binary relationships are a line connecting entity sets, with name of relationship next to line.
</p>

<p>
if relationship set has attributes, name of relationship set is written in box along with attributes of relation; box is connected with dashed line to the relation line.
</p>

<p>
non-binary relationship sets are drawn witha diamond.
</p>

<p>
important differences:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
keys:

<ul>
<li>
ER supports keys with underlining

<li>
UML has no standard for keys

</ul>
<li>
aggregation:

<ul>
<li>
ER: treating relationship set as entity

<li>
UML: part-whole relation (non-exclusive composition)

</ul>
<li>
weak entities:

<ul>
<li>
ER: entities without own key

<li>
UML: composition is similar, but says nothing about keys

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Databases-Conceptual to relational models"><h2 id="Conceptual to relational models" class="header"><a href="#Databases-Conceptual to relational models">Conceptual to relational models</a></h2></div>
<p>
entity sets and relationship sets are represented as tables
</p>
<ul>
<li>
name of table is name of entity/relationship set

<li>
columns (unique names) usually correspond to attributes

</ul>

<p>
a strong entity set becomes a table with columns for the attributes.
</p>

<p>
a weak entity set becomes table with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
columns for the attributes

<li>
columns for the primary keys of the identifying entity

</ul>

<p>
many-to-many relationship set becomes table with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
columns for attributes of relationship

<li>
columns for primary keys of participating entity sets

</ul>

<p>
many-to-(zero or one) relations can be represented by adding extra attribute/column to the many-side with primary key of one-side
</p>

<p>
for one-to-one relationship sets, either side can have the key of the other.
</p>

<p>
if participation is partial (0..1), replacing table by an attribute will lead to null values for those that don't participate.
</p>

<p>
if participation is total, foreign key should be <code>NOT NULL</code>.
</p>

<p>
tables for relationship sets linking weak entity sets to identifying entity set can always be eliminated.o
</p>

<p>
when translating sets to tables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
every table should have a primary key

<li>
declared foreign key references for each relationship

<li>
declared whether foreign keys are nullable

<li>
declared unique if appropriate

</ul>

<p>
composite attributes are flattened out by creating separate column for each component attribute. 
</p>

<p>
multi-valued attribute A of entity set E is represented by separate table with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
columns for primary key of E

<li>
column for attribute value

<li>
each single value of multi-valued attributes gets its own row

</ul>

<p>
Is-a to relational model:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Method 1: hierarchy of tables

<ul>
<li>
table for higher-level entity set

<li>
table for each lower-level entity set (includes primary key of higher-level entity set &amp; local attributes)

</ul>
<li>
Method 2: many tables

<ul>
<li>
form table for each entity set with all local &amp; inherited attributes

<li>
if specialisation is total, we don't need table for generalised entity - table for generalised entity can be defined as view containing union of specialisation tables

</ul>
<li>
Method 3: one table with null values

<ul>
<li>
form a single table with all local and specialised attributes

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
recursive association: translates to foreign key that refers to the same table
</p>
<ul>
<li>
requires separate table with two foreign keys to parent table

</ul>

<div id="Databases-SQL Overview"><h2 id="SQL Overview" class="header"><a href="#Databases-SQL Overview">SQL Overview</a></h2></div>
<div id="Databases-SQL Overview-Basics"><h3 id="Basics" class="header"><a href="#Databases-SQL Overview-Basics">Basics</a></h3></div>
<p>
Basic query: <code>SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition is true</code>
</p>

<p>
The <code>FROM</code> clause is like declaring variables that range over tuples of a relation:
</p>

<pre SQL>
SELECT  E.ENO, E.TOPIC  -- choose columns ENO, TOPIC
FROM    EXERCISES E     -- table exercises, E being an 'alias' for the current row
WHERE   E.CAT = 'H'     -- where the column CAT contains the value 'H'
</pre>

<p>
If name of tuple variable ('E' in the code above) is not given explicitly, the variable will have the name of the relation ('EXERCISES' in the code above).
</p>

<p>
A reference to attribute A of variable R may be written as <code>A</code> if R is <em>the only tuple variable</em> with an attribute named A.
</p>

<p>
It is almost always an error if there are two tuple variables that aren't linked via join conditions.
</p>

<p>
Don't join more tables than needed.
</p>

<p>
In some scenarios, we might have to consider more than one tuple of the same relation to get a result tuple.
</p>

<p>
Duplicates have to be explicitly eliminated, using <code>DISTINCT</code>.
</p>

<p>
Sufficient condition for superfluous DISTINCT, where K is set of attributes uniquely determined by result.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Assume WHERE clause is a conjunction. Let K be the set of attributes in the SELECT clause.

<li>
Add to K attributes A s.t.:

<ul>
<li>
A = c for a constant c is in the WHERE clause

<li>
A = B for B ∈ K is in the WHERE clause

<li>
if K contains key of a tuple variable, add all attributes of that variable

</ul>
<li>
Repeat 2 until K is stable.

<li>
If K contains a key of every tuple variable listed under <code>FROM</code>, then <code>DISTINCT</code> is superfluous.

</ol>

<p>
Typical mistakes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
missing join conditions

<li>
unnecessary joins (may slow down query)

<li>
self joins with incorrect treatment of multiple tuple variables over same relation, missing conditions

<li>
unexpected duplicates

<li>
unnecessary <code>DISTINCT</code>

</ul>

non-monotonic: 'there is no', 'does not exist', 'for all', 'min/max'. testing whether or not a query yields an empty result.
</p>

<p>
example to select students without any homework result:
</p>

<pre SQL>
SELECT  FIRST, LAST
FROM    STUDENTS
WHERE   SID NOT IN (SELECT  SID
                    FROM    RESULTS
                    WHERE   CAT = 'H')
</pre>

<p>
conceptually, the subquery (<code>SELECT SID...</code>) is evaluated before main query.
</p>

<p>
constructs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>NOT IN</code>: something is not in result of subquery

<li>
<code>NOT EXISTS</code>: result of subquery is empty

</ul>
