<p>
HCI is concerned with design, evaluation, implementation of interactive computer systems
</p>

<p>
how people use software &amp; computing devices. usability engineering:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
design

<li>
evaluation

<li>
implementation of interactive computing systems

</ul>

<p>
why is it important? because sites have shitty UIs and UXs and we've all had to use them &amp; it sucks
</p>

<p>
website metrics: volume of business, num of unique visitors, conversion rate from visitor to customer, loyalty rate, bounce rate, pages viewed per visit
</p>

<p>
business metrics: conversion rates, traffic numbers, user performance, target feature usage
</p>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-User experience (UX) elements"><h2 id="User experience (UX) elements" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-User experience (UX) elements">User experience (UX) elements</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
form: graphic design, product design

<li>
content: information architecture, audio-visual, text

<li>
behaviour: interaction design observation

</ul>

<p>
UX deliverables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
analysis &amp; research: personas, qualitative user research/reports, user stories, competitive analysis, scorecards

<li>
design: functional specs, flow diagrams, UI specs

<li>
prototypes: clickable prototypes, mockups

<li>
visual design: polished design &amp; layout, icons &amp; graphic things

<li>
technical communications: web content, help, guides, videos, localization

</ul>

<p>
Terms of interaction:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
domain: area of work under study (like graphic design)

<li>
goal: what you want to achieve

<li>
task: how you go about doing it, in terms of operations/actions

</ul>

<p>
gulf of execution: user's formulation of actions ≠ actions allowed by the system
gulf of evaluation: user's expectation of changed system state ≠ actual presentation of that state
</p>

<p>
human errors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
slip: incorrect action (need better interface design)

<li>
mistake: may not have the right goal (need better undrstanding of system)

</ul>

<p>
goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
efficiency/productivity? effective learning?

<li>
usability goals: meeting specific usability criteria

<ul>
<li>
effectiveness

<li>
efficiency (minimal steps, simple)

<li>
safety (does the system prevent users from fuckin up?)

<li>
learnability: people are impatient, manuals are tedious, nobody wants to fuckin do it. they should be able to learn the system in under 10 minutes.

<li>
utility: the extent to which system provides functionality that user needs

<li>
memorability: meaningful icons, command names, menus, so that the user can remember shit without always having to go back to the manual

</ul>
<li>
user experience goalz: develop the quality of the user experience (<code>a e s t h e t i c</code>, games)

<ul>
<li>
design isn't just about efficiency and productivity

<li>
the point is, do you feel nice and warm inside while using the system?

</ul>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
Visibility

<ul>
<li>
if more stuff is visible, the user's more likely to know what to do next

<li>
when functions are hidden, it makes them more difficul to find and know how to use

</ul>
<li>
Feedback

<ul>
<li>
send back info about what actions have been done, what's bee accomplished

<li>
audio, tactile, verbal, etc.

</ul>
<li>
Constraints

<ul>
<li>
determine ways to restrict possible kind of user interaction

</ul>
<li>
Mapping

<ul>
<li>
relationship between controls and their effects in world

<li>
e.g. up/down arrows to represent up/down movement of cursor

</ul>
<li>
Consistency

<ul>
<li>
design interfaces that have similar operations and elements for similar tasks

<li>
follows rules

</ul>
<li>
Affordance

<ul>
<li>
refers to an attribute of object that allows people to know how to use it

<li>
e.g. mouse button invites pushing

<li>
'afford': 'give a clue'

</ul>
</ol>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Usability principles"><h2 id="Usability principles" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Usability principles">Usability principles</a></h2></div>
<p>
Nielsen usability principles:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Visibility of system status

<ul>
<li>
always keep user informed about what's happening

<li>
like a progress bar

</ul>
<li>
Match between system and real world

<ul>
<li>
speak the users' language

<li>
use words, phrases, concepts familiar to user

</ul>
<li>
User control and freedom

<ul>
<li>
allow users to easily escape from places where they accidentally appeared

<li>
like 'emergency exits'

</ul>
<li>
Consistency and standards

<ul>
<li>
don't make the user think

<li>
avoid making them wonder whether different shit is actually the same shit

</ul>
<li>
Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors

<ul>
<li>
write errors in plain language

<li>
suggest a way of solving it.

</ul>
<li>
Error prevention

<ul>
<li>
prevent errors whenever possible

</ul>
<li>
Recognition is better than recall

<ul>
<li>
make stuff recognisable

</ul>
<li>
Flexibility and efficiency of use

<ul>
<li>
provide accelerators invisible to novices

<li>
give more experienced users more tools

</ul>
<li>
Aesthetic &amp; minimalist design

<ul>
<li>
don't include irrelevant or rarely needed information

<li>
<span id="Human Computer Interaction-Usability principles-hide the stuff"></span><strong id="hide the stuff">hide the stuff</strong>

</ul>
<li>
Help and documentation

<ul>
<li>
provide info that can be easily searched

<li>
give concrete steps that can be easily followed

</ul>
</ol>
