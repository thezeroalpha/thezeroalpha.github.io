<p>
HCI is concerned with design, evaluation, implementation of interactive computer systems
</p>

<p>
how people use software &amp; computing devices. usability engineering:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
design

<li>
evaluation

<li>
implementation of interactive computing systems

</ul>

<p>
why is it important? because sites have shitty UIs and UXs and we've all had to use them &amp; it sucks
</p>

<p>
website metrics: volume of business, num of unique visitors, conversion rate from visitor to customer, loyalty rate, bounce rate, pages viewed per visit
</p>

<p>
business metrics: conversion rates, traffic numbers, user performance, target feature usage
</p>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-User experience (UX) elements"><h2 id="User experience (UX) elements" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-User experience (UX) elements">User experience (UX) elements</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
form: graphic design, product design

<li>
content: information architecture, audio-visual, text

<li>
behaviour: interaction design observation

</ul>

<p>
UX deliverables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
analysis &amp; research: personas, qualitative user research/reports, user stories, competitive analysis, scorecards

<li>
design: functional specs, flow diagrams, UI specs

<li>
prototypes: clickable prototypes, mockups

<li>
visual design: polished design &amp; layout, icons &amp; graphic things

<li>
technical communications: web content, help, guides, videos, localization

</ul>

<p>
Terms of interaction:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
domain: area of work under study (like graphic design)

<li>
goal: what you want to achieve

<li>
task: how you go about doing it, in terms of operations/actions

</ul>

<p>
gulf of execution: user's formulation of actions ≠ actions allowed by the system
gulf of evaluation: user's expectation of changed system state ≠ actual presentation of that state
</p>

<p>
human errors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
slip: incorrect action (need better interface design)

<li>
mistake: may not have the right goal (need better understanding of system)

</ul>

<p>
goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
efficiency/productivity? effective learning?

<li>
usability goals: meeting specific usability criteria

<ul>
<li>
effectiveness

<li>
efficiency (minimal steps, simple)

<li>
safety (does the system prevent users from fuckin up?)

<li>
learnability: people are impatient, manuals are tedious, nobody wants to fuckin do it. they should be able to learn the system in under 10 minutes.

<li>
utility: the extent to which system provides functionality that user needs

<li>
memorability: meaningful icons, command names, menus, so that the user can remember shit without always having to go back to the manual

</ul>
<li>
user experience goalz: develop the quality of the user experience (<code>a e s t h e t i c</code>, games)

<ul>
<li>
design isn't just about efficiency and productivity

<li>
the point is, do you feel nice and warm inside while using the system?

</ul>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
Visibility

<ul>
<li>
if more stuff is visible, the user's more likely to know what to do next

<li>
when functions are hidden, it makes them more difficult to find and know how to use

</ul>
<li>
Feedback

<ul>
<li>
send back info about what actions have been done, what's bee accomplished

<li>
audio, tactile, verbal, etc.

</ul>
<li>
Constraints

<ul>
<li>
determine ways to restrict possible kind of user interaction

</ul>
<li>
Mapping

<ul>
<li>
relationship between controls and their effects in world

<li>
e.g. up/down arrows to represent up/down movement of cursor

</ul>
<li>
Consistency

<ul>
<li>
design interfaces that have similar operations and elements for similar tasks

<li>
follows rules

</ul>
<li>
Affordance

<ul>
<li>
refers to an attribute of object that allows people to know how to use it

<li>
e.g. mouse button invites pushing

<li>
'afford': 'give a clue'

</ul>
</ol>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Usability principles"><h2 id="Usability principles" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Usability principles">Usability principles</a></h2></div>
<p>
Nielsen usability principles:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Visibility of system status

<ul>
<li>
always keep user informed about what's happening

<li>
like a progress bar

</ul>
<li>
Match between system and real world

<ul>
<li>
speak the users' language

<li>
use words, phrases, concepts familiar to user

</ul>
<li>
User control and freedom

<ul>
<li>
allow users to easily escape from places where they accidentally appeared

<li>
like 'emergency exits'

</ul>
<li>
Consistency and standards

<ul>
<li>
don't make the user think

<li>
avoid making them wonder whether different shit is actually the same shit

</ul>
<li>
Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors

<ul>
<li>
write errors in plain language

<li>
suggest a way of solving it.

</ul>
<li>
Error prevention

<ul>
<li>
prevent errors whenever possible

</ul>
<li>
Recognition is better than recall

<ul>
<li>
make stuff recognisable

</ul>
<li>
Flexibility and efficiency of use

<ul>
<li>
provide accelerators invisible to novices

<li>
give more experienced users more tools

</ul>
<li>
Aesthetic &amp; minimalist design

<ul>
<li>
don't include irrelevant or rarely needed information

<li>
<span id="Human Computer Interaction-Usability principles-hide the stuff"></span><strong id="hide the stuff">hide the stuff</strong>

</ul>
<li>
Help and documentation

<ul>
<li>
provide info that can be easily searched

<li>
give concrete steps that can be easily followed

</ul>
</ol>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Prototypes"><h2 id="Prototypes" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Prototypes">Prototypes</a></h2></div>
<p>
Prototype: representation of design before final version exists.
Can be low fidelity to high fidelity media.
</p>

<p>
options for prototypes: sketches, diagrams, frameworks, hand made models, graphics, virtual models, role play, video, etc.
</p>

<p>
why?
to evoke reactions from stakeholders (find out what to add/change), to test feasibility, choose between alternatives, etc.
it's faster than changing the real thing.
</p>

<p>
Waterfall model
</p>
<ul>
<li>
long lifecycle, step by step

<li>
does not work

</ul>

<p>
Iterative prototyping
</p>
<ul>
<li>
more like an agile method

<li>
each iteration is short (2-6 weeks)

<li>
do minimum necessary

<li>
after every iteration you get feedback

<li>
system grows incrementally

</ul>

<p>
quality is a function of num of iterations &amp; refinements before production.
fail early and often.
</p>

<p>
3 stages of prototyping:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Prototypes-Designing the prototype"><h3 id="Designing the prototype" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Prototypes-Designing the prototype">Designing the prototype</a></h3></div>
<p>
choose what to prototype for, identify measurable design goals
</p>

<p>
Describe the user's journey:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Who is the user?

<li>
How do they discover the app/site?

<ul>
<li>
let's assume for our project that they were recommended our app

</ul>
<li>
How do they use it?

<li>
How do they benefit from it?

</ul>

<p>
Aim to show why the app/site will work.
</p>

<p>
Prototyping:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Low fi (early stage)

<ul>
<li>
Use whatever works (paper and pen, photo, video, whatever)

<li>
Paper prototypes: when you have many ideas, parts are unclear, basically if you're gonna throw away stuff

</ul>
<li>
Medium fi

<ul>
<li>
Don't add filler text

<li>
Wireframing: idea needs more detail than on paper, colors, clients need to see major design options

<li>
Mockups with wood, play doh, whatever. Just fake the design

<li>
Wizard of Oz: some aspects of interface are implemented, operation needs processing that's actually done by a human for now

</ul>
<li>
High fi

<ul>
<li>
Screen mockups (illustrator, photoshop, whatever)

<li>
Clickthroughs (slideshow type stuff)

<li>
Web tools (like Bootstrap)

<li>
Web prototypes

<ul>
<li>
plain HTML/CSS

<li>
use when systems is intended to run on the web

</ul>
<li>
Small screen prototypes

<ul>
<li>
JS (all phones have a browser, JS has a lot of functionality)

<li>
can add events, interactions, etc.

<li>
you can use mobile emulators on desktop

<li>
but it's hard to prototype touch gestures (JS works decently)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Goal directed design"><h3 id="Goal directed design" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Goal directed design">Goal directed design</a></h3></div>
<p>
Design activity that links requirements to implementation (what do you need, why? what are you solving?)
</p>

<p>
Generally, you have marketers, decision makers, and developers making decisions, and the result is shit.
What's missing is the user's perspective: goals, actions, motivations, responses, and the context (how it fits into the user's wider activities)
</p>

<p>
Design interactions - mental models
The user's mental model is not the implementation model, the user has to adapt to understand the implementation.
It's better if design model is good fit for user model (unless it hides important features)
</p>

<p>
Steps in design process:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Research users: observation, interview, etc

<li>
Discover non-user goals (business, technical, whatever else)

<li>
Develop personas

<li>
Use personas in scenarios to establish design requirements

<li>
Find the functional requirements - use cases

</ul>

<p>
Users react to a product on 3 levels:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Visceral - the user's <em>immediate</em> reaction before even using the product, should trigger emotional responses that are appropriate

<li>
Behavioural - we need design that fits where the user currently is with knowledge, assumptions, and mental models

<li>
Reflective - integrating product and its values into wider life, and if done well, you get brand loyalty

</ul>

<p>
User goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Experience: how the user wants to feel (visceral)

<li>
End goals: what the user wants to do

<li>
Life goals: who the user wants to be

</ul>

<p>
Non-user goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Customer goals (the customer is <em>not</em> the user, like corporate IT buyers)

<li>
Business/organisational goals (increasing profit, market share, reducing costs, increase QOS)

<li>
Technical goals (maintaining security, cross-platformness, backwards compatibility)

</ul>

<p>
User stories &amp; goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As a &lt;type of user&gt; I want &lt;some goal&gt; so that &lt;some reason&gt;

<li>
As a &lt;persona&gt; I want &lt;action&gt; so that &lt;expected outcome&gt;

<li>
When &lt;situation&gt; I want to &lt;motivation&gt; so I can &lt;expected outcome&gt;

</ul>

<p>
Modelling users: identify major goals and behaviours, then build models of idealised users ("personas")
</p>

<p>
There isn't an 'average user', you use personas that capture important characteristics of users.
</p>

<p>
Persona:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Demographic details: name, occupation, age

<li>
Personal details: short biographical summary

<li>
Attitudinal deetails: mental model, pain points, feelings about stuff that has to be done

<li>
Goals and motivations: for using the product (maybe for life in general™)

<li>
Behavioural details: how they act when using the product

<li>
generally about half a page in length

</ul>

<p>
Why?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Coordination, getting a shared vision of the users and market

<li>
Communication between devs, designers, marketers, other stakeholders

<li>
Determining functionality and behaviour o product

<li>
Help design decisions without testing on users

<li>
they work. you don't focus on edge cases but on normal use, avoids the self-referential user (developers thinking users are like them), and avoids the elastic user (cuz users won't bend to your will, they don't give a shit)

</ul>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Scenarios"><h3 id="Scenarios" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Scenarios">Scenarios</a></h3></div>
<p>
Informal narrative descriptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
describe human activities in short stories

<li>
You can exlprore needs, requirements, contexts

<li>
Don't explicitly mention tech

<li>
Are written in the users' language (well, english in our case)

<li>
Have varying levels of detail

<li>
You focus on the user's perspective

</ul>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Design Requirements &amp; principles"><h3 id="Design Requirements &amp; principles" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Design Requirements &amp; principles">Design Requirements &amp; principles</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
Establish needs &amp; goals

<ul>
<li>
what info do users need?

<li>
what capabilities?

<li>
what goals must be achieved (business, technical)?

</ul>
<li>
Brainstorm

<ul>
<li>
time-limited, like half an hour

<li>
write them <em>all</em> down

<li>
no criticism allowed

<li>
ideas are culled and refined later

</ul>
</ol>

<p>
Don't make the user feel stupid.
Define what the product will do before designing how.
</p>

<div id="Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Use Case"><h3 id="Use Case" class="header"><a href="#Human Computer Interaction-Personas, Scenarios, and use cases-Use Case">Use Case</a></h3></div>
<p>
Focus on user-stystem interaction instead of user's task itself.
Describe processes as text or use case diagram
