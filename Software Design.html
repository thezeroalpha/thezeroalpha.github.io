<div id="Software Design-Introduction"><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2></div>
<p>
We are only evaluated on weeks 1-6.
</p>

<p>
Lectures are not definitive, study the books (links on canvas).
</p>

<p>
Grading: project is 70%, exam is 30% (!)
</p>

<p>
project goal: develop a ROBOSEARCH system with various UML-based techniques. implement a simple demonstrator via a robotic 3D simulator.
</p>

<div id="Software Design-Software abstraction &amp; modeling"><h2 id="Software abstraction &amp; modeling">Software abstraction &amp; modeling</h2></div>
<p>
software engineering: the application of engineering to software. a programmer writes a complete program, a software engineer creates a component.
</p>

<p>
engineers abstract away from details that can be <em>safely</em> ignored.
</p>

<p>
model: simplified/partial representation of reality, defined to accomplish a task or reach an agreement
</p>

<p>
abstraction: generalizing – setting aside specific and individual features
</p>

<p>
software design: creating models representing an abstract view of the system
</p>

<div id="Software Design-Software abstraction &amp; modeling-Models"><h3 id="Models">Models</h3></div>
<p>
what is a model?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
mapping feature: a model is based on an original

<li>
reduction feature: a model only reflects a relevant selection of the original's properties

<li>
pragmatic feature: a model needs to be usable in place of an original with respect to some purpose

</ul>

<p>
consumer and intent influence the abstraction level of a model
</p>

<p>
descriptive models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a subject is described by the model

<li>
sketches and throw-away models – short life time, used to better understand the reality

<li>
models of ideas and vision about the system to be developed – to exploit model for having feedback before actually implementing the system

<li>
models extracted from a running system or code – e.g. to visualize all calls between Java classes

</ul>

<p>
prescriptive models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a model prescribes the subject

<li>
the subject does not yet exist

<li>
the models guide the development of the system

<li>
most common consumers are code generators

<li>
often used for development, so their importance may decay when the system is implemented

</ul>

<div id="Software Design-Software development process"><h2 id="Software development process">Software development process</h2></div>

<p>
main activities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
requirements engineering

<ul>
<li>
specifies the main functionalities of the system

<li>
defines the qualities to be met

</ul>
<li>
design

<ul>
<li>
give shape to a system via models

<li>
not a clear-cut sequential process

</ul>
<li>
implementation and testing

<ul>
<li>
involves actual development of the system

<li>
component testing – test individual components independently

<li>
system testing – test the system as a whole (including emergent properties like overall performance)

<li>
acceptance testing – test with customer data to see if the system meets the customer's needs

</ul>
<li>
evolution

<ul>
<li>
software is inherently flexible and can change

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="img-design/waterfall-dev.png" alt="Waterfall dev process image" />
</p>

<p>
exists in many variants, all with sequential flow. it's document-driven.
</p>

<p>
issues: poor agility (when do you know how far you are in the project?), poor quality (cuts if you run out of time), high risk (finding issues in test phase)
</p>

<p>
critical evaluation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
positive:

<ul>
<li>
precise planning and management – standard-oriented

<li>
postpone implementation to after understanding objectives

<li>
good documentation

</ul>
<li>
negative:

<ul>
<li>
hard to get all requirements once and for all (users might not even know what they want)

<li>
rigid

<li>
no feedback from the customer

<li>
no parallelism, all phases are blocking (because sequential)

<li>
a single delivery date at the end

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Software Design-Software development process-Agile development process"><h3 id="Agile development process">Agile development process</h3></div>
<p>
iterative development processes with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
frequent releases of the product

<li>
continuous interaction between dev team and customer

<li>
reduced product documentation

<li>
continuous and systematic assessment of produced value and risks

</ul>

<p>
agile in practice:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
make a list

<li>
estimate

<li>
set priorities

<li>
start executing

<li>
update the plan at run time

</ul>

<p>
critical evaluation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
positive:

<ul>
<li>
acceptance of change – less risky

<li>
frequent and short iterations

<li>
emphasis on working code

<li>
associates a test with every piece of functionality

<li>
continuous integration and delivery

</ul>
<li>
negative:

<ul>
<li>
feature-based development &amp; ignorance of dependencies

<li>
no strong quality plan

<li>
less focus on architecture of system (in fact, dismisses everything that isn't shippable)

</ul>

<div id="Software Design-Requirements engineering with UML-What is UML?"><h3 id="What is UML?">What is UML?</h3></div>
<p>
A unified modeling language, the defacto standard for software design.
</p>

<p>
pros:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
not tied to a development process

<li>
can be used across the whole life cycle

<li>
general purpose, can model all sorts of shit

<li>
has different representations (graphical, but also text)

</ul>

<p>
main characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
comprehensive: can describe all parts of a system

<li>
scalable: "zoom in" and add more details if you want

<li>
originally intended for descriptive models

<li>
now also supports prescriptive models

</ul>

<p>
formal modeling language — its core concepts have a well-defined meaning
</p>

<p>
UML model is represented graphically with diagrams
</p>

<p>
The different types:
</p>

<p>
<img src="img-design/uml-diagrams.png" alt="Diagram of diagrams" />
</p>

<p>
The ones we will use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
use case diagram: to specify the basic functionality of a software system (requirements)

<li>
class diagram: to define data structures within the system

<li>
state machine diagram: to define intra-object behavior

<li>
sequence diagram: to specify inter-object behavior and communication

</ul>

<p>
a UML <em>model</em> contains everything related to the system. a <em>diagram</em> is just a "window" on the model (shows some parts, but not necessarily everything).
</p>

<div id="Software Design-Requirements engineering with UML-Requirements engineering"><h3 id="Requirements engineering">Requirements engineering</h3></div>
<p>
the process of establishing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
features that a system should and will have

<li>
constraints under which it operates and is developed

</ul>

<p>
requirement can range between:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
high-level abstract statement of a feature

<li>
detailed mathematical functional specification

</ul>

<p>
functional (what) vs non-functional (how) requirements
</p>
<ul>
<li>
functional: services the system should provide, how it should react to inputs, how it should behave in specific situations, opt. what it shouldn't do.

<ul>
<li>
precise — ambiguous requirements may be interpreted in different ways by developers and users

<li>
complete — they should include descriptions of <em>all</em> facilities required

<li>
consistent — there should be no conflicts or contradictions in descriptions of system facilities

<li>
verifiable — requirements should be directly mapped to parts of system

</ul>
<li>
non-functional: constraints on services/functions offered by the system, often apply to system as a whole instead of individual features/services

<ul>
<li>
system properties and constraints (e.g. reliability, response time, storage requirements)

<li>
may be more critical than functional, like safety requirements

<li>
may affect overall architecture of a system instead of individual components (like organization to minimize communications between robots)

<li>
different types:

<p>
requirements are written as natural language sentences. used because it's expressive, intuitive, universal, easily understood by customers.
</p>

<p>
guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
invent a standard format, use it for all requirements.

<li>
use language in a consistent way ("shall" for mandatory requirements, "should" for desirable requirements)

<li>
highlight text to identify important parts of requirement

<li>
avoid use of computer jargon

<li>
include explanation (rationale) of why a requirement is needed

</ul>

<div id="Software Design-Requirements engineering with UML-Requirements engineering-Use case diagrams"><h4 id="Use case diagrams">Use case diagrams</h4></div>
<p>
express expectations of customers/stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
answers questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
what is being described? (the system)

<li>
who interacts with the system? (the actors)

<li>
what can the actors do? (use cases)

</ul>

<p>
use case:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
describes functionality expected from system under development

<li>
set of all use cases describes functionality that a system shall provide.

<li>
notations:

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img-design/use-case-notations.png" alt="Use case notations" />
</blockquote>

<p>
actors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
interact with the system by using use cases, or by being used by use cases.

<li>
represent roles that users adopt (users can have multiple roles)

<li>
not part of the system, so outside of system boundaries.

<li>
human or non-human

<li>
primary/secondary:

<ul>
<li>
if primary, has main benefit of execution of use case.

<li>
if secondary, receives no direct benefit.

</ul>
<li>
active or passive

<ul>
<li>
active: initiates execution of the use case

<li>
passive: provides functionality for the execution of the use case

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img-design/actor-notations.png" alt="Actor notations" />
</blockquote>

<p>
relationships between use cases and actors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
actors are connected with use cases via associations (solid lines)

<li>
every actors has to communicate with at least one use case

<li>
association is always binary, multiplicities can be specified

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img-design/usecase-actor-rel.png" alt="Relationships between actors and use cases" />
</blockquote>

<p>
relationships between use cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
«include»

<ul>
<li>
behavior of one use case ('included') <em>is always</em> integrated in the behavior of another use case ('base')

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img-design/usecase-include-rel.png" alt="Include relationship" />
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
«extend»

<ul>
<li>
behavior of one use case ('extending') <em>may be</em> integrated in behavior of another use case ('base')

<li>
both use cases can also be executed independently of each other

<li>
extension points are written directly in the use case. you can specify multiple extension points.

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img-design/use-case-extensions.png" alt="Extensions in use cases" />
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
generalization of use cases

<ul>
<li>
if use case A generalizes use case B, then B inherits behavior of A and may extend/overwrite it. B also inherits all relationships form A.

<li>
A may be labeled {abstract} — cannot be executed directly, only B is executable

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img-design/usecase-generalisation.png" alt="Generalisation" />
</blockquote>

<p>
relationships between actors
</p>
<ul>
<li>
generalization

<ul>
<li>
actor A inherits from actor B. e.g. A can communicate with X and Y, B can only communicate with Y.

<li>
abstract actors are possible

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img-design/actor-generalization.png" alt="Actor generalization" />
</blockquote>

<p>
Description of use cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Name

<li>
Short description

<li>
Precondition: prerequisite for successful execution

<li>
Postcondition: system state after successful execution

<li>
Error situations: errors relevant to problem domain

<li>
System state on occurrence of an error

<li>
Actors that communicate with the use case

<li>
Trigger: events which initiate the use case

<li>
Standard process: individual steps to be taken

<li>
Alternative processes: deviations from the standard process

</ul>

<p>
Remember, it's an abstraction. Many small use cases with the same objective should be grouped. Don't decompose functionality into use cases.

<ul>
<li>
transitive: if B is part of A and C is part of B, C is also part of A

<div id="Software Design-Structure modeling with UML-Creating a class diagram"><h3 id="Creating a class diagram">Creating a class diagram</h3></div>
<p>
nouns often indicate classes. adjectives indicate attribute values. verbs indicate operations.

<p>
focus on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
responsibility of each class (private is default, <code>getter</code> and <code>setter</code> methods)

<li>
knowledge needed by each class (tend toward generality, don't focus on order of tasks)
