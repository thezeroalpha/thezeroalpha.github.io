this should be a slightly philosophical post
inspired by a comment by /u/1y251251251225 where talked about jumping into vim and nvim with tmux and being absolutely overwhelmed
big fancy frameworks coming out, multitude of tools, everything has plugins and shit
it's easy to get overwhelmed. so go against that, start out small.
learn a tool. then, try to see what the next tool is solving/simplifying, and add it if you need it. don't add it 'just because'.
e.g. i learned vim first. then tmux. then i3. i learned bash first. then i saw what zsh had to offer, and integrated it.
