This is my first post, just checking if everything's working correctly.

Why is my username ZeroAlpha?
ZeroAlpha is 0A.
In the ASCII table, the hexadecimal value 0x0A represents the "line feed", or the "newline" (\n).
You have to insert a newline every time you want to execute a command, by pressing the enter key.
The newline is the only way to launch a process, run a command, essentially to do anything in the shell prompt.
That's what the name means.

Here's some Python code:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello World")

say_hello()
```
